# SolidJS with SuperTokens Prebuilt UI

This demo app demonstrates how to integrate SuperTokens into a SolidJS application.

Features:

-   Initializes SuperTokens with frontend and backend configurations
-   Creates a frontend page to handle authentication-related tasks
-   Integrates the SuperTokens' pre-built login UI for secure user authentication
-   Protects frontend to ensure only authenticated users can access the dashboard

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
